# Polymarket BTC Monitor

A Python-based tool to monitor **Polymarket's 15-minute Bitcoin (BTC) Up/Down prediction markets**. Features real-time data logging and an interactive dashboard for analyzing market behavior and identifying potential opportunities.

## Features

### Data Collection
- **Automated Market Detection**: Automatically finds the currently active 15-minute BTC market
- **Real-time Data Logging**: Continuously fetches and logs market data.
- **Configurable**: The dashboard's data file path is now determined automatically and hardcoded.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles incomplete data and API failures with a retry mechanism.
- **CSV Storage**: Historical data stored in `market_data.csv` for analysis, with optional daily rotation.

### Interactive Dashboard
- **Live Auto-Refresh**: Automatically updates periodically (every second) to ensure the latest data is displayed.
- **Advanced Visualization**:
  - Probability trends for Up/Down contracts
  - Market transition indicators (vertical lines)
  - Data point markers for clarity
  - Gaps for zero/missing values
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Manual refresh button
  - Auto-refresh toggle
  - "Reset Zoom" - view all historical data
  - "Zoom Last 15m" - focus on recent activity (follows new data)
  - Scroll zoom and range slider

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Borisz42/PolymarketAnalyst.git
   cd PolymarketAnalyst
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pytz streamlit pandas plotly
   ```

## Usage

### Full Dashboard Experience

**Step 1: Start the Data Logger**
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
python data_logger.py
```
This will continuously fetch market data every 10 seconds and save it to `market_data.csv`.

**Step 2: Launch the Dashboard**
Open a **new** terminal and run:
```bash
python -m streamlit run dashboard.py
```
The dashboard will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Dashboard Tips
- Enable **Auto-refresh** to see updates in real-time as data is logged
- Use **Zoom Last 15m** to track the most recent market activity
- Hover over the charts to see exact values with the unified crosshair
- The charts are linked - zooming one automatically zooms the other

## How It Works

The system identifies the **Active Market** by finding the 15-minute interval that has started but not yet expired:

- **Start Time**: Beginning of the 15-minute candle
- **Expiration**: End of the 15-minute candle  
- **Contract Prices**: Live "Yes" (Up) and "No" (Down) prices from Polymarket's CLOB

Contracts pay out based on whether the price at **Expiration** is higher ("Up") or lower ("Down") than the **Strike Price**.
