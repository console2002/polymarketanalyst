# Polymarket BTC Monitor

A Python-based tool to monitor **Polymarket's 15-minute Bitcoin (BTC) Up/Down prediction markets**. Features real-time data logging and an interactive dashboard for analyzing market behavior and identifying potential opportunities.

## Features
Recent updates have brought significant improvements to both the backtesting capabilities and the data logging service, enhancing overall analysis and strategy development.

### Data Collection
- **Automated Market Detection**: Automatically finds the currently active 15-minute BTC market
- **Real-time Data Logging**: Continuously fetches and logs market data.
- **CSV Storage**: Historical data stored in `market_data.csv` for analysis, with optional daily rotation.

### Interactive Dashboard
- **Live Auto-Refresh**: Automatically updates periodically (every second) to ensure the latest data is displayed.
- **Advanced Visualization**:
  - Probability trends for Up/Down contracts
  - Market transition indicators (vertical lines)
  - Data point markers for clarity
  - Gaps for zero/missing values
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Manual refresh button
  - Auto-refresh toggle
  - "Reset Zoom" - view all historical data
  - "Zoom Last 15m" - focus on recent activity (follows new data)
  - Scroll zoom and range slider

### Backtester
A script (`backtester.py`) that simulates the execution of a trading strategy on historical Polymarket data.

#### Strategy
The backtester now employs the `DerivativeMovingAverageStrategy`. This strategy analyzes the price movement by calculating a moving average of price derivatives.

- It tracks the `DERIVATIVE_MA_PERIOD` (e.g., 10 periods) moving average of price changes.
- If the derivative moving average for 'UpPrice' exceeds a `DERIVATIVE_THRESHOLD` (e.g., 0.005), it suggests an upward trend, and the strategy buys 'Up' shares.
- If the derivative moving average for 'DownPrice' falls below `-DERIVATIVE_THRESHOLD`, it suggests a downward trend, and the strategy buys 'Down' shares.
- Trades are considered on every `N_TICK_POINT`-th data point for a given market, allowing for less frequent trading.
- The backtester supports multiple open positions for the same market ID.

#### Winning Condition
A direction (Up or Down) is considered to have "won" if its own price is exactly $0 at the last available data point before the market's expiration date. Each share of the winning side pays out $1. If neither side's price reaches exactly $0, the trade is considered a loss for the position held.

#### Configuration
The backtester's behavior can be easily adjusted by modifying the following global variables at the beginning of `backtester.py`:
- `INITIAL_CAPITAL`: The starting capital for the simulation (default: $1000.0).
- `SHARE_SIZE`: The number of shares to buy in each trade (default: 2).
- `DERIVATIVE_MA_PERIOD`: The number of periods for calculating the moving average of the derivative (default: 10).
- `DERIVATIVE_THRESHOLD`: A small threshold (e.g., 0.005) used to filter out minor fluctuations in the derivative moving average.
- `N_TICK_POINT`: Determines trading frequency, e.g., trade on every N-th data point (default: 1).

#### Consolidated Market Summaries
Upon market resolution, the backtester now provides a single, consolidated summary for each market. This summary includes the total PnL, total shares traded for 'Up' and 'Down' sides, and their average entry prices, offering a clear overview of market performance rather than individual position resolutions.


#### How to Run Data fetcher and Dashboard

**Step 0: Run setup**
Open a terminal and run:
```bat
setup.bat
```

When setup finishes, use the exact commands it prints:
```
==============================================================
Setup complete.
==============================================================
Next steps:
  1) Run the data logger:
       .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe data_logger.py
  2) In a new terminal, start the dashboard:
       .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run dashboard.py
```

This will continuously fetch market data every 10 seconds and save it to `market_data.csv`. The dashboard will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

#### How to Run backtester

Ensure `market_data.csv` contains historical data (generated by running `data_logger.py` for a sufficient period). Then, execute the backtester:
```bash
python backtester.py
```
The script will output a report including final capital, total PnL, and the number of winning and losing trades.

### Arbitrage Backtester
A new script (`backtester_arbitrage.py`) has been introduced to backtest arbitrage strategies. This backtester focuses on identifying and exploiting price discrepancies between different markets or contracts within Polymarket.

#### How to Run Arbitrage Backtester
Ensure `market_data.csv` contains historical data. Then, execute the arbitrage backtester:
```bash
python backtester_arbitrage.py
```
This script will analyze historical data for arbitrage opportunities and report on potential profits.

### Dashboard Tips
- Enable **Auto-refresh** to see updates in real-time as data is logged
- Use **Zoom Last 15m** to track the most recent market activity
- Hover over the charts to see exact values with the unified crosshair
- The charts are linked - zooming one automatically zooms the other

## How It Works

The system identifies the **Active Market** by finding the 15-minute interval that has started but not yet expired:

- **Start Time**: Beginning of the 15-minute candle
- **Expiration**: End of the 15-minute candle  
- **Contract Prices**: Live "Yes" (Up) and "No" (Down) prices from Polymarket's CLOB

Contracts pay out based on whether the price at **Expiration** is higher ("Up") or lower ("Down") than the **Strike Price**.
